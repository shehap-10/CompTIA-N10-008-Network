- IDF vs MDF
    
    زي العداد كهرباء في كل بيت في عداد وفي عداد كبير اول دور في العماره
    
    - main distribution frame (MDF)
        - Imagine the MDF as the “headquarters” of your network. It’s like the central command center.
        - **Function**:
            - **Incoming Data**: When data arrives from the outside world (like the internet), it first lands at the MDF.
            - **Distribution**: The MDF then routes this data to different parts of the building.
    - Intermediate distribution frame (IDF)
        
        Passive cable termination
        – Punch down blocks
        – Patch panels
        
        All transport media Copper, fiber, voice and data
        
        It helps extend connectivity from the MDF to specific areas within the building.

- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**:

    - **Examples**:
        - **Internet Providers**: They promise a certain speed and uptime (no internet downtime).
        - **Cloud Services**: If you use Google Drive or Dropbox, they have SLAs about data availability and response times.
- **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**:

    - **Examples**:

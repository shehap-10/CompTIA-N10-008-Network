1. **Best Practices:**
    - **Secure SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** SNMP is used for managing and monitoring network devices. To secure it, change default community strings (passwords), restrict SNMP access to trusted hosts, and use SNMPv3 with encryption.
    - **Router Advertisement (RA) Guard:** Prevents rogue routers from sending unauthorized RA messages. It ensures that only legitimate routers can advertise network prefixes.
    - **Port Security:** Limits the number of MAC addresses allowed on a switch port, preventing unauthorized devices from connecting.
    - **Dynamic ARP Inspection:** Verifies ARP packets to prevent ARP spoofing attacks.
    - **Control Plane Policing:** Protects control plane traffic (routing protocols, management traffic) from overload or attacks.
    - **Private VLANs:** Isolates devices within the same VLAN, enhancing security.
    - **Disable Unneeded Switchports:** Turn off unused switch ports to reduce attack surface.
    - **Disable Unneeded Network Services:** Disable unnecessary services (e.g., unused protocols) on network devices.
    - **Change Default Passwords:** Always change default passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Password Complexity/Length:** Enforce strong password policies.
2. **Additional Measures:**
    - **Enable DHCP Snooping:** Prevents rogue DHCP servers by allowing only authorized DHCP servers to respond to client requests.
    - **Change Default VLAN:** Avoid using the default VLAN (usually VLAN 1) for security reasons.
    - **Access Control List (ACL):** Filter traffic based on rules to control access between networks.
    - **Role-Based Access:** Assign permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
    - **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewall rules to allow or deny specific traffic.
    - **Explicit Deny:** Explicitly deny unwanted traffic in ACLs or firewall rules.
    - **Implicit Deny:** Deny all traffic that doesn’t match any allow rule.
    - 
    - **Secure SNMP**: Securing SNMP by using SNMP version 3, which moves to ports 10161 and 10162, enhances security by enabling secure authentication and communication between SNMP manager and agent.
    - **Router Advertisement Guard**: Configuring IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard protects the network from spoofing by unauthorized routers by securing multicast messages used by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
    - **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**: DAI secures networks against ARP spoofing by inspecting ARP packets and using the DHCP snooping table to validate them, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **Control Plane Policing**: Control Plane Policing (CoP) allows routers and switches to use QoS filters to protect against DoS attacks, ensuring packet forwarding continues despite high traffic loads or anomalies.
    - **Private VLANs**: Private VLANs restrict communication between switch ports, allowing only specific uplinks (typically to routers or firewalls), enhancing security by isolating traffic within the VLAN.
    - **Disable Unneeded Switch Ports**: Disabling unnecessary switch ports and services prevents unauthorized access by eliminating unused entry points, enhancing overall network security.
    - **Change Default Credentials**: Changing default device credentials and enforcing strong, complex passwords prevent unauthorized access, addressing a common security vulnerability.
    - **Enable DHCP Snooping**: DHCP snooping allows switches to filter DHCP traffic based on predefined rules, blocking rogue DHCP servers from assigning IP addresses and protecting network integrity.
    - **Change Default VLAN**: Changing the default native VLAN from VLAN 1 to another VLAN enhances security by preventing attackers from exploiting known network configurations.
    - **Patch and Firmware Management**: Regularly updating device firmware and patches, after thorough testing, ensures optimal performance, compatibility, and security by addressing known vulnerabilities.
    - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: ACLs control network traffic by allowing or denying specific users or systems access to network resources based on predefined rules.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: RBAC limits user access based on roles, assigning the minimum necessary privileges to perform job functions, thereby enforcing the principle of least privilege.
    - **Firewall Rules**: Firewall rules regulate traffic between networks, with actions like block, allow, or conditionally allow based on security criteria, including implicit and explicit deny permissions.

### **Wireless Security:**

- **MAC Filtering:** Allow only specific MAC addresses to connect to the wireless network.
- **Antenna Placement (rang):** Optimize antenna placement for better coverage and security.
- **Power Levels:** Adjust transmit power to limit coverage to desired areas.
- **Wireless Client Isolation:** Prevent wireless clients from communicating directly with each other.
- **Guest Network Isolation:** Isolate guest networks from internal networks.
- **Preshared Keys (PSKs):** Use strong PSKs for WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication.
- **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol):** Use EAP methods (like EAP-TLS) for stronger authentication.
- **Geofencing:** Restrict wireless access based on physical location.
- **Captive Portal:** Authenticate users through a web portal before granting network access.
1. **IoT Access Considerations:**
    - When dealing with IoT devices, consider network segmentation, secure protocols, and regular updates to address vulnerabilities.
    1. **Detection Methods:**
        - **Camera:** Surveillance cameras monitor physical spaces, providing visual evidence and deterring unauthorized access.
        - **Motion Detection:** Sensors trigger alerts when movement is detected in restricted areas.
        - **Asset Tags:** Labeling assets with unique identifiers helps track their location and prevents theft.
        - **Tamper Detection:** Alarms activate if someone tries to tamper with devices or access points.
    2. **Prevention Methods:**
        - **Employee Training:** Educate staff on security protocols, social engineering risks, and physical access control.
        - **Access Control Hardware:** Use locks, card readers, and biometric systems to restrict entry.
            - **Badge Readers:** Authenticate users based on their badges or access cards.
            - **Biometrics:** Fingerprint or retina scans enhance security.
        - **Locking Racks and Cabinets:** Secure servers and networking equipment.
        - **Access Control Vestibule (Mantrap):** A secure area with two doors to prevent tailgating.
        - **Smart Lockers:** Safely store personal belongings.
    3. **Asset Disposal:**
        - **Factory Reset/Wipe Configuration:** Before disposing of devices, erase data and restore them to factory settings.
        - **Sanitize Devices for Disposal:** Physically destroy storage media to prevent data leaks.
    
    ### **VPN (Virtual Private Network) Types:**
    
    - **Site-to-Site VPN:** Connects entire networks securely over the internet.
    - Clientless VPNs
        - Hypertext Markup Language version 5 The language commonly used in web browsers without a separate VPN application
    - **Client-to-Site VPN:**
        - **Clientless VPN:** Web-based access without installing a client.
        - **Split Tunnel vs. Full Tunnel: (using web)** Split tunnel routes only specific traffic through the VPN, while full tunnel routes all traffic.

## TCP flags

- **SYN**
    
    **Details:** Starts a connection; sets sequence numbers.
    

---

- **ACK**
    
    **Details:** Confirms data received; has a valid acknowledgement number.
    

---

- **FIN**
    
    **Details:** Ends a connection; no more data to send.
    

---

- **RST**
    
    **Details:** Stops a faulty connection right away.
    

---

- **URG**
    
    **Details:** Prioritizes this data; uses the Urgent Pointer handled urgently by the receiver.
    

---

- **PSH**
    
    **Details:** Sends data immediately without waiting.
    

---

- **WND**
    
    **Details:** Shows how much data can be received; manages data flow.
    

---

- **CHK**
    
    **Details:** Checks if the data is correct.
    

---

- **SEQ (Sequence Number)**
    
     unique number assigned to each segment Orders segments for proper data assembly.
    

---

- **ACK Number (Acknowledgement Number)**
    
    **Details:** Shows the next expected sequence number.
    

---

- **MTU**
    - The maximum size of a packet that can be sent over a network medium without fragmentation. handled at the Network Layer (Layer 3)

### Ethernet header

- Where is the Ethernet header located within the OSI model, and what is its purpose?
    
    process at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It contains essential information necessary for transmitting data frames over Ethernet (LAN) networks.
    

### Ethernet Header Components

- What is the **Preamble**, how many bytes does it consist of, and what is its purpose?
    - A sequence of 8 bytes (64 bits) for synchronization and signaling frame start.
    - Helps the receiver synchronize its clock with the incoming bit stream.

---

- What is the **(SFD):** , how many bytes does it consist of, and what is its purpose?
    - **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD):** A one-byte field (8 bits) indicating end of preamble and start of frame.
    - Marks beginning of frame's payload.

---

- What is the  **MAC Address**, how many bytes does it consist of, and what is its purpose?
    - A 6-byte (48-bit) field specifying MAC address of intended recipient device.

---

- **EtherType/Length Field:**
    - For Ethernet II frames: Specifies payload type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6).
    - For IEEE 802.3 frames: Indicates frame's data payload length.

---

- **Payload:**
    - Size varies based on payload type (e.g., IP packet, ARP request).

---

- What is the **(FCS)** , how many bytes does it consist of, and what is its purpose?
    - **Frame Check Sequence (FCS):** A 4-byte (32-bit) field containing CRC for error detection.
    - Used by receiver to verify frame integrity.

### IP Header (IPv4)

1. **Version**: 4 bits, IP protocol version.
2. **Header Length**: 4 bits, IP header length {This tells the receiving device where the header ends and the actual datna begins.}
3. **Type of Service (ToS)**: 8 bits, priority and service type {Low delay for voice calls, high reliability for file transfers}
4. **Total Length**: 16 bits, entire packet length including the header and data.
5. **Identification**: 16 bits, packet fragment identification.
- **Flags**: 3 bits, control flags (DF, MF).
    
    Control flags used for fragmentation. The most common flags are:
    
    - **DF (Don't Fragment)**: Indicates that the packet should not be fragmented.
    - **MF (More Fragments)**: Indicates that there are more fragments following this one.
1. **Fragment Offset**: 13 bits, fragment position.
2. **Time to Live (TTL)**: 8 bits, packet lifespan.
3. **Protocol**: 8 bits, next layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).
4. **Header Checksum**: 16 bits, error-checking.
5. **Source IP Address**: 32 bits, sender's IP address.
6. **Destination IP Address**: 32 bits, recipient's IP address.
7. **Options**: Variable length, additional options.

### TCP Header

1. **Source Port**: 16 bits, sender's port number.
2. **Destination Port**: 16 bits, recipient's port number.
3. **Sequence Number**: 32 bits, data ordering.
4. **Acknowledgment Number**: 32 bits,  indicates the next byte the sender expects to receive. 
5. **Data Offset**: 4 bits, TCP header length.
6. **Reserved**: 3 bits, : To provide space for future functionality or features in the TCP protocol.
7. **Flags**: 9 bits, control flags:
    - **URG (Urgent)**: Prioritizes certain data.
    - **ACK (Acknowledgment)**: Validates acknowledgment number.
    - **PSH (Push)**: Requests immediate data delivery.
    - **RST (Reset)**: Resets the connection.
    - **SYN (Synchronize)**: Initiates a connection.
    - **FIN (Finish)**: Terminates a connection.
    - **ECE (ECN-Echo)**: Indicates congestion encountered.
    - **CWR (Congestion Window Reduced)**: Manages network congestion.
    - **NS (Nonce Sum)**: Adds protection against certain attacks.
8. **Window Size**: 16 bits indicates the amount of data that the sender of this segment is willing to receive
9. **Checksum**: 16 bits, error-checking.
10. **Urgent Pointer**: 16 bits used when the URG flag is set in the TCP header. It indicates the position of the last byte of urgent data in the segment.
11. **Options**: Variable length, additional options.
12. **Data**: Variable length, payload data.

### Wi-Fi Antenna Types

**1. Omnidirectional Antennas:**

- **Coverage:** 360-degree coverage area.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for broad indoor areas or large open spaces.
- **Pros:** Even signal distribution, simple installation.
- **Cons:** Limited range, less focused signal.

**2. Directional Antennas:**

- **Coverage:** Focused signal in a specific direction.
- **Types:**
    - **Yagi Antennas:**
        - **Use Case:** Point-to-point communication over moderate distances, often outdoors.
        - **Pros:** High gain, compact.
        - **Cons:** Narrow coverage, requires precise alignment.
    - **Parabolic Antennas:**
        - **Use Case:** Long-distance communication, such as connecting two buildings.
        - **Pros:** Very high gain, long distances.
        - **Cons:** Large size, complex installation, narrow focus.

**3. Performance and Gain:**

- **Gain:** Higher gain means stronger signal (measured in dB).
- **Omnidirectional Gain:** Typically 2-8 dB.
- **Directional Gain:** Typically 10-30 dB or more.

### Wireless Network Security

**1. Importance of Securing Wireless Networks:**

- **Sensitive Information:** Sent over the network needs to be protected.
- **Authentication:** Users must be authenticated before accessing the network (username, password, possibly multifactor authentication).

**2. Wireless Encryption Protocols:**

- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):**
    - **Introduction:** 2002, as a replacement for WEP.
    - **Encryption:** Uses RC4 cipher and TKIP, each packet has its own encryption key.
- **WPA2:**
    - **Introduction:** 2004, uses CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol).
    - **Encryption:** Uses AES, ensures data confidentiality and integrity.
- **WPA3:**
    - **Introduction:** 2018, uses GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol).
    - **Improvements:** Stronger encryption, mutual authentication, prevents brute force attacks, incorporates perfect forward secrecy.

**3. Authentication Methods:**

- **Pre-shared Key (PSK):**
    - **Home Networks:** Same key across all devices.
    - **Enterprise Networks:** Uses WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise or 802.1X for individual usernames and passwords, authenticated via an authentication server (e.g., Active Directory, RADIUS).

**4. Key Exchange and Security:**

- **WPA2 Vulnerability:** Potential brute force attacks on hashed passwords.
- **WPA3 Enhancement:** Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) prevents hash interception and brute force attacks.

### Key Takeaways

- **Use Omnidirectional antennas for broad, even coverage; directional antennas for focused, long-distance communication.**
- **Secure your wireless network with strong encryption (WPA3) and proper authentication (WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise).**
- **Ensure data confidentiality and integrity with robust encryption methods and secure key exchange protocols.**

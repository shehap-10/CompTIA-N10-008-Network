- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
    - SaaS allows users to access applications via the Internet. Instead of installing software on their local machines, users simply use a web browser to access the application.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
    - PaaS is primarily for developers. It provides a platform that includes development tools, database management systems, servers, storage, and networking solutions.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
    
    • Organizations use IaaS to reduce costs associated with buying and managing on-premises servers and data centers.
    
- **Desktop as a Service (DaaS)**:
    - DaaS provides virtual desktops to end users. Authorized users can access files and applications using these virtual desktops from any internet-connected device.

Designing the cloud
• **Multitenancy** 

On-demand computing power
– Click a button
• Elasticity
– Scale up or down as needed
• Applications also scale
– Scalability for large implementations
– Access from anywhere
• Multitenancy
– Many different clients are using the same cloud
infrastructure ensuring isolation, 

### Connectivity options

- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:
    - A VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between two networks over the public internet. It allows remote users or branch offices to securely access resources within a private network.
- **Private-Direct Connection to Cloud Provider**:
    - This refers to dedicated, private connections between your on-premises infrastructure and a cloud provider (like AWS Direct Connect or Azure ExpressRoute). It bypasses the public internet, providing better performance and security.
- **VM Sprawl Avoidance**:
    - VM sprawl occurs when too many virtual machines (VMs) are created without proper management. It leads to resource wastage, increased complexity, and difficulty in tracking VMs.
- **VM Escape Protection**:
    - VM escape refers to breaking out of a VM’s isolated environment and gaining unauthorized access to the host operating system or other VMs.
